## Description

The **Codac Logistics Delivery & Fuel Auditor** is a console-based C# application designed to help delivery drivers and the accounting department monitor fuel expenses and delivery performance over a 5-day work week.

The program collects driver information, validates travel distance, records daily fuel expenses, computes fuel efficiency, and determines whether the driver stayed within the weekly fuel budget.

---

## Objectives

- Gather driver profile information  
- Validate weekly distance input  
- Track fuel expenses for five days  
- Compute total and average fuel costs  
- Evaluate fuel efficiency rating  
- Check if spending stayed within budget  
- Generate a formatted audit report  

---

## Technologies Used

- C# Console Application  
- .NET  
- Visual Studio  

---

## Key Features

- Driver profile input  
- Distance validation using **while loop**  
- 5-day fuel tracking using **1D array**  
- Expense processing using **for loop**  
- Efficiency rating using **if/else**  
- Budget check using **bool**  
- Formatted audit report output  

---

## Efficiency Rating Logic

The fuel efficiency is calculated using:


| Condition | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| > 15 | High Efficiency |
| ≥ 10 | Standard Efficiency |
| < 10 | Low Efficiency / Maintenance Required |
